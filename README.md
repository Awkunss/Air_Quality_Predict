## Introduction
Air quality prediction is crucial for public health and environmental monitoring. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict air quality based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to air quality, such as pollutant levels, weather conditions, and timestamps. The data is preprocessed and cleaned before being used for model training.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/awkunss/Air_Quality_Predict.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Air_Quality_Predict
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Air_Quality_Predict_using_ML.ipynb
    ```

## Results
The notebook includes detailed analysis and visualizations of the dataset, as well as the performance metrics of the trained models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in predicting air quality.
